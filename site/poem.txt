The tumbleweeds tumbled lazily 
And the saguaros sagged saggedly
And the sun beat sunnedly 
On the deserty desert
Then the cocky cowboy burst into town on his gallopy horse
The Indian warrior saw the cowboy approaching
And shot his arrow
It came pretty close, but it missed
The cowboy felt an arrow whizz by
He was sure it was just a coincidence
Little did he know that many arrows would follow
